Cancer KnowLedger
====================

The Cancer KnowLedger is a public decentralized database for somatic cancer variants. The KnowLedger will contain whole genome somatic cancer variants, though the available data for a given participant may vary based on the tests that were performed for that individual. In addition to variants, the database will contain general clinical data such as age group and cancer type.

Here is a PDF of slides that give a general overview of the KnowLedger: [ACGI Cancer KnowLedger Slides](ACGI-ledger-slides-May2016.pdf)
